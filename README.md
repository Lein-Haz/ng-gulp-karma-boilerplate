## Start file watch

gulp watch
```
Run this command to start BrowserSync serve and watch without going through build first.
**Note:** This is in case you inadvertently stopped BrowserSync, a build has to be run prior to using
 this command by itself.
- all file within /src will be watched for changes and injected into browser thanks to BrowserSync
- a recovery command that is merely step 11 of the above `gulp` command, if BrowserSync stops for some reason
